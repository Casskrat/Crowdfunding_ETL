# Crowdfunding_ETL
Worked with a team to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and Python dictionary methods to extract and transform the data. After we transform the data, we created four CSV files and used the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally,we upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.
